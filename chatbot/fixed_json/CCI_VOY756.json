Implementation is complete\nand documented. No further actions pending. Change closed on April 18, 2025.\nDescription of Change\nThe mixing sequence for Aryl Piperazine HCl and Sodium Acetate was revised to introduce\nSodium Acetate first, followed by gradual addition of Aryl Piperazine under controlled RPM.\nThis adjustment minimizes foaming and improves homogeneity. SOP-MFG-104 updated to\nreflect new sequence and RPM parameters.\nCAPA\nCAPA ID: CAPA-VOY756-02\nRoot Cause: Improper mixing order leading to excessive foaming and material loss\nCorrective Action: Revise mixing sequence and validate new process\nPreventive Action: Update SOP and train all relevant personnel\nEffectiveness Check: Completed – No foaming observed in three validation batches\n| Trainee\nName | Role | Training\nDate | Trainer | Training Material\nRef |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arjun Patel | Manufacturing\nOperator | April 14,\n2025 | Vishal\nMehta | TM-MIXSEQ-2025 |\n| Sneha Rao | QA Associate | April 14,\n2025 | Vishal\nMehta | TM-MIXSEQ-2025 |\n| Ravi Narayan | Documentation\nAnalyst | April 15,\n2025 | Priya Desai | TM-MIXSEQ-2025 |\n\n| Approver Name | Role | Approval Date | Signature |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Priya Desai | QA Manager | April 16, 2025 | ✅ |\n| Kunal D’Souza | Production Head | April 16, 2025 | ✅ |\n| Hana Takeda | Regulatory Affairs | April 17, 2025 | ✅ |\n\n\n\nChange Control",
