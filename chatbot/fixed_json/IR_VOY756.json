The foam overflowed the\nmixing vessel, resulting in a material loss of approximately 0.3 kg and a 45-minute delay in\nprocessing. No contamination occurred, and the batch was contained.\nInitial Classification: Minor Deviation\nDeviation ID: DR-VOY756-03\nInvestigation Findings\n• Root Cause Identified: Improper mixing sequence—Aryl Piperazine HCl was added\nbefore Sodium Acetate, contrary to recommended order\n• Contributing Factors:\no Operator followed outdated SOP version (SOP-MFG-104 v2.1 instead of v2.3)\no Inadequate version control in batch documentation binder\no Lack of visual cue or checklist for mixing order on equipment panel\n• No impact on product quality confirmed by QC testing (assay, dissolution, impurity\nprofile all within spec)\n• No recurrence in subsequent batches after correction\n\n\n\nInvestigation Report\nCorrective Action\nAction Item Responsible Due Date Status\nPerson\nUpdate SOP-MFG-104 to include visual Priya Desai April 20, Completed\nmixing checklist 2025\nRetrain all operators on revised SOP version Vishal Mehta April 21, Completed\n2025\nImplement version control audit for batch Ravi Narayan April 22, Completed\nbinders 2025\nAdd mixing order prompt to equipment HMI Kunal D’Souza April 25, In\npanel 2025 Progress\nCAPA Reference: CAPA-VOY756-02\nEffectiveness Check Plan: Monitor next 5 batches for foam volume and adherence to SOP\nchecklist\n| Action Item | Responsible\nPerson | Due Date | Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Update SOP-MFG-104 to include visual\nmixing checklist | Priya Desai | April 20,\n2025 | Completed |\n| Retrain all operators on revised SOP version | Vishal Mehta | April 21,\n2025 | Completed |\n| Implement version control audit for batch\nbinders | Ravi Narayan | April 22,\n2025 | Completed |\n| Add mixing order prompt to equipment HMI\npanel | Kunal D’Souza | April 25,\n2025 | In\nProgress |",
